Geo-Ov2

This module provides easy interface for reading and writing TomTom ov2 POI files.

In package is also included scrpt ttn2device, which can do some merging of
POI groups and also creates pi.dat. Behavior of this script is controled by
configuration file which must be located in "./", "./etc/", "../etc/", "/etc/",
"/etc/POI/", "/etc/POIs/", "/etc/local/POI/" or "/usr/local/etc/POI/"
and it's name must be one of "catgroup.conf", "catgroup.cfg", "catgroup_rc",
"catgroup".
Another way of suplying own config file is to use -f commandline parameter,
followed by path and name of config file.

Syntax of calling ttn2device:

ttn2device [-f configfile] [source [destination]]

If source or destination is not specified on command line, it is taken
from section _DEFAULT_ in config file.

Example of config file:
======== cut ==========
<_DEFAULT_>
	srcDir=/home/public/POI/data
	destDir=/home/public/POI/todevice
</_DEFAULT_>

<category Parkoviste_pujcovny.ov2>
	id=9930
	filename=Rent Car Parking.ov2
</category>

<category GeoCaching.ov2>
	filename=CZ-Geocaching-multi.ov2
	filename=CZ-Geocaching-mystery.ov2
	filename=CZ-Geocaching-traditional.ov2
	filename=CZ-Geocaching-virtual.ov2
	filename=CZ-Geocaching-webcam.ov2
	icon=/somepath/somefile.bmp
</category>
======== cut ==========
If id is specified, category is added to poi.dat and original file is removed.
If icon is not supplied, script tries to find it in srcDir with name of category,
but with extension bmp except of ov2.
